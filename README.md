# 1AttrCrossSheets
Gives you the highest value across all sheets in the same folder as the program in the given skill/talent (write skill or skill/ if you don't want to specify a talent). If tied, it is random.

## Install
There is no install. Just download and run.

## Run
Start the script using the commandline and write `-s skill/talent`. Defaults to `-s Wahrnehmung/Wachsamkeit` since it is often needed (translates to perception/awareness).

## Compatibility
Supports the large Gatsu sheet and the regular one. Bugs are possible. It is not thoroughly tested yet.
